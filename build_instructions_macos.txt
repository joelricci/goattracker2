To build under MacOS (Intel or Apple Silicon):

1. Install libsdl by using Homebrew:
   (if you don't already have Homebrew installed, consult the internet)
    > brew install sdl12-compat

2. Install Xcode command line developer tools:
    > xcode-select --install

3. Clone or unarchive GoatTracker to a folder near you. Open the path in the Terminal app.

4. Build GT2 by going to the 'src' directory and running make:
    goattracker2> cd src
    src> make 

5. Go to the 'linux' folder and run 'goattrk2':
    src> cd ../linux
    linux> ./goattrk2

    --- or copy to your desktop:

    src> cp ../linux/goattrk2 $HOME/Desktop 


6. Remember to hold the FN-key when accessing F1 to F12 keys on Mac. 
Alternatively go to System Settings, search for "function keys" and change 
the default setting. You may also want to disable some shortcuts, like Exposition, 
depending on your keyboard and OS version.

Enjoy!
